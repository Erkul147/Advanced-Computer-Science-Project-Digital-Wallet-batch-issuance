# Digital Wallet: Batch Issuance

A research project exploring **unlinkability** in **batch issuance of digital wallets**, developed as part of the **Master’s program at Roskilde University**.

---

##  Overview

This project investigates how **digital information** and **wallet issuance mechanisms** can be designed to ensure **unlinkability** - which will prevent RPs and IdP to link a person to multiple places. 

The prototype focuses on a **Batch Issuance** model, where 30 credentials or proofs (Merkle trees) are issued simultaneously, and when used up are automatically requested.

##  Tech Stack

- **Java (Spring Boot)** – Backend controllers and APIs

##  Research Focus

The project primarily addresses:

1. **Unlinkability in Batch Issuance**  
   How to issue multiple credentials or wallets without allowing an issuer or verifier to link them to a single user.

2. **Efficiency vs. Privacy Trade-offs**  
   Evaluating performance implications of privacy-preserving techniques in batch operations.

3. **Protocol Modeling**  
   Designing and simulating batch issuance workflows within a controlled environment.
